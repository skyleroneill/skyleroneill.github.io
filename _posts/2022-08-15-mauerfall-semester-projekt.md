## About Mauerfall Erforschung

Mauerfall Erforschung, "Fall of the wall research" in English, is an educational game about exploring the history and impact of the Berlin Wall. This game was made as my final project for German 301 in the 2019 Fall semester at UMBC. All text in the game is in German. The gameplay involves exploring two locations related to the Berlin Wall, talking with locals to hear their thoughts and feelings on the Wall, and interacting with information kiosks to learn the history of the Wall. 

## Programming Work

All code was written by me. I wrote code for AI, player control, menu UI, cameras, and more. Most of the code was repurposed from, Sludger, another project I was working on at the same time.

## Artwork

Character art and animation was done by me. Character designs are based on the art style of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell">Kurzgesagt â€“ In a Nutshell</a>.
