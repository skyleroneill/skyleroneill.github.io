## About Little Golem

Little Golem is a puzzle adventure game which revolves around the mechanics of shifting gravity and rolling to solve puzzles. This project is a tutorial/demo developed as part of the UMBC Game Developers Club. Development began in August 2017 and lasted until June 2018. The team was composed of 5 people.

## The Team
* <b><a href="https://skyleroneill.github.io/about/">Skyler O'Neill</a></b>: Project Lead, Programmer, and Level Designer
* <b><a href="https://www.zachchale.com/">Zachariah Hale</a></b>: Programming Lead and 3D Artist
* <b>Josh Ludlow</b>: Art Lead, Environment Modeller
* <b>Mario Moya</b>: Music, Concept Artist, and 3D Artist
* <b>Miguel Fuentes</b>: 3D Character Artist and Animator

## My Contributions

In addition to leading the project, I also contributed much to the programming and design of the game.

### Player Mode Shifting

I created a method by which the player would be able to shift between walking, rolling, or tilting gravity. Each of these modes has fundamentally different movement, so we needed a way to alternate between them seemlessly.

### Gravity Tilting Mechanics

I, along side the programming lead, coded a mechanic where the player is able to tilt gravity in a direction. Doing so causes everything to move in that direction as though gravity was shifted, while the player remains stuck in place. I primarily coded the tilting lanterns.

### Rolling and Dashing

The second of the player's abilities in Little Golem is to curl into a ball and roll. Doing so allows the player to reach places inaccessible while walking. In addition to rolling, the player can charge up and release a spin dash for a quick burst of speed.

### Level Design

I designed all of the levels within Little Golem. I put an emphasis on teaching the player each mechanic in isolated instances and gradually building up to more complicated uses of each mechanic.
