## About Mind Upload: Cardboard Edition

Mind Upload is a game about little cardboard robots or cardbots in a cardboard world. The player must switch between controlling the different robots to reach the end goal.

This game was made as part of the 2018 Global Game Jam. This game was a solo project. You can find it on the GGJ website here: <b><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/mind-upload-cardboard-edition">Link to GGJ site</a></b>

## The Mechanics

#### Body Switching

The primary mechanic of Mind Upload is switching between cardbots that have different abilities. This is done by sending a transmission between two bots as seen below. The player can only control one cardbot at a time and must use proper placement of idle cardbots to reach the end goal.

#### Cardbot Abilities

There was only enough time to include three types of cardbots, each with a unique ability. These three bots are:

Hammer bot, the most mobile of the three.
