I am a student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) within the Computer Science undergraduate program. I will graduate in Spring 2020. I am also a member of UMBC's Game Developers Club. With the Game Developers Club I have finished one game and am currently working on another.When it comes to game development, I enjoy doing gameplay programming and design, and level design.

I am interested in gaining opportunities to begin working in the professional game development scene and gaining industry experience.

Outside of my school and career aspiration, I enjoy playing piano, practising my German, and playing with my cat, Possum.
