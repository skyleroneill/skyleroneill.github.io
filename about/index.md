I'm a Jr software engineer for Firaxis games in Sparks, MD. I'm currently doing gameplay programming for the upcoming title, <a href="https://midnightsuns.2k.com/">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>. The majority of my work on Midnight Suns has been in the Abbey where the player interacts with the game's roleplaying mechanics.

Outside of work, I enjoy DMing Dungeons and Dragons, playing kalimba and piano, and teaching my cat tricks. I am also working on a personal project that will eventually be posted on this site.
